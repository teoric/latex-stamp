  summary: Audit the OSS licenses of your application's dependencies.
  description: "  Do you know the licenses of all your application's dependencies?
    What open source software licenses will your business accept?\n\n  LicenseFinder
    culls your Gemfile, detects the licenses of the gems in it, and gives you a report
    that you can act on. If you already know \n  what licenses your business is comfortable
    with, you can whitelist them, leaving you with an action report of only those
    dependencies that have \n  licenses that fall outside of the whitelist.\n"
